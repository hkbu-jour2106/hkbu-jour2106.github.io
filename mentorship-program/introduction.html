    <h1>Topics</h1>

    <ul>

      <li>
          <strong>Hong Kong Trees</strong> -
          The raw data set contains trees information at Central and Western Hong Kong. The factors include Location, Species, Condition, Mitigation Measures, Location Map,  Inspection Info, etc. It may be interesting to analyze and visualize the distribution and configuration of the tree cover in Hong Kong.
      </li>
      <li>
          <strong>Hong Kong Long-term Competitiveness Research</strong> -
         In recent years, there have been concerns of the trend of diminishing competitiveness of Hong Kong. Maintaining long-term competitiveness is not only an economic matter, but also a key to providing sufficient development opportunities for the youth and sustaining high quality of life for different walks of life.
Savantas Policy Institute has commissioned Professor Ho Lok Sang, Head of the Department of Economics of Lingnan University, to conduct a 15-month large-scale study into the city's long-term competitiveness.      </li>
      <li>
          <strong>Hong Kong Craft Beer</strong> -
         Hop Leaf is the original Hong Kong craft beer importer, with home delivery, retail and wholesale, beer of the month subscriptions and gifts. Its monthly sales figures can be broken down by style of beer, IPA vs. pilsner vs. pale ale, etc. It may be fun to compare and visualize how sales change overall and as percentages over the months, by region, etc.       </li>
      <li>
          <strong>Travelling in North Korea</strong> -
        Overview of North Korea (DPRK), travel status from the global perspective.
Interview of the founders for their background story and perspective. 
Illustration of a typical travel route in DPRK. Introduce the scenes/ POIs along the way. 
Analyse and visualise the customer data. Who went to DPRK (Age, occupation, residential area, visiting time, etc.) Can do charting of the profiles. Can plot a time series for travel volume.
Text analysis of the 50 reviews about DPRK tours. Can do a tag cloud. Can visualise the keyword evolution over time.
      </li>
      <li>
          <strong>Air Quality</strong> -
        My initial project idea to visualize relationship between air pollution and weather data (mainly wind direction and speed),
