                <h1>Call for External Mentor</h1>

                <p>HKBU <a href="https://hkbu-jour2106.github.io">JOUR2106 Data Visualisation for News</a> is calling for external mentors to work with the students on course projects.</p>

                <p>The Mentorship Program brings small groups of 4 to 6 students together with one mentor to do a final project. The final delivery of course project is a functioning website with interactive storytelling or data visualization. Mentors we invited are experienced professionals/ senior executives in different industries who have a desire to help young people by sharing their knowledge and skills.</p>

                <p>As a mentor, you are expected to bring your topic or areas of interest, and it would be even better if you could provide students with some raw data sets for analysis and visualization. After groups assigned, a kick-off meeting will be soonly arranged in which mentors could have brainstorming session with your students to come up with an appropriate topic and approach for the group project. Mentors will provide background knowledge, general advice and feedback to students, guide the students through the process of the whole project.</p>

                <h3>About the course </h3>

                <p>The course mainly focuses on data visualisation although it covers basic data analytics and data journalism workflow just to be self-contained. Among many visualisation techniques and tools, this course focuses on the web stack, because most content are distributed via (mobile) web-based technology at present. More detailed course information could be reached at: <a href="https://hkbu-jour2106.github.io">https://hkbu-jour2106.github.io/</a>

                <h3>About mentorship </h3>

                <p>Being a mentor is rewarding. You not only have fun with the students but also work with the dedicated teaching team to introduce latest web-based visualisation technology into your project. Having access to our talent pool way before summer can also ensure you an advantageous position if you are looking for new team members.</p>
